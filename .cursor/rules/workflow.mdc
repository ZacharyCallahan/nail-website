# Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevent to the task

- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task

- write thorough test for all major functionality

- avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how features work, after it has shown to woirk well, unless
explicitly structed

- always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affect by code changes
